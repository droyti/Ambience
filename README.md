# Ambience

Ambience is a mod for The Walking Dead: The Telltale Definitive Series that allows you to free-roam the boarding school.

## Installation

Install me using the Telltale Mod Launcher available at https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/TelltaleModLauncher
Optionally, manual installation is possible by dragging the contents of this archive to the "Archives" folder.

## Usage

The mod will create a button in the main menu titled "Ambience".
Upon clicking, you'll spawn in the graveyard at the boarding school.

When near enterable doors, you'll see a prompt at the bottom of your screen with information about where they lead and how to use them.
