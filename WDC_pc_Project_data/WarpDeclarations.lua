Notes:

The IDs must ALWAYS be unique within a scene.

Some gnarly stuff might happen if 2 warps are too close to each-other (read: within each-others ranges),
so it's probably a good idea to keep them reasonably separated.

These are designed to be as versatile as possible (despite not looking quite as pretty as the vanilla ones),
so you can put just about any code you want within the Activate function.
